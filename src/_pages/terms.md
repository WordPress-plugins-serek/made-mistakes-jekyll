## Privacy Policy

I consider the privacy of my visitors to be extremely important. This privacy policy document describes in detail the types of personal information is collected and recorded by odd-one-out.serek.eu and how I use it. I will not share your email address or any other personal information to anyone without your direct consent.

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
In order to comply with GDPR I have choosen to prevent working with and storing personably identifiable data anywhere possible. The [regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679) states that:

> The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes [^1].

Where my site does fall under the GDPR, I will explicitly mention below.

#### Statistics
This sites does not use any analytics tools like Google Analytics. However this site uses CloudFlare as a DNS and CDN provider and they do collect some basic anonymized data to present statistical information about number of unique visitors, number of request, bandwidth and potential blocked threats. Read more [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/analytics/).

#### Affiliate links

#### Log files
This site does not keep any log files, however the services that this site use does use logfiles (GitHub, CloudFlare and Algolia). These files merely log visitors to the service â€“ usually a standard procedure for hosting companies to troubleshoot and prevent abuse. The information inside the log files typically include

* Internet Protocol addresses (IP)
* Browser type

#### GitHub

#### CloudFlare
This sites uses CloudFlare for DNS and CDN. This means that when your browser fetches this sites address and ressources, it goes through CloudFlare for performance optimization reasons. CloudFlare does mention that they log in [compliance with GDPR](https://www.cloudflare.com/gdpr/introduction/).

#### Algolia
This sites uses Algolia as a search engine to provide search results as you type your query.

[^1]: The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.
